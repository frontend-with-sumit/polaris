## Description
The project is a dashboard UI implemented in ReactJS and TypeScript, offering users the ability to upload CSV files and visualize the data using Chart.js for creating charts. This choice was made due to Chart.js's robustness and user-friendly features, making it an ideal fit for implementing these functionalities.

The UI design is constructed entirely in ReactJS and utilizes TypeScript for strong typing, enhancing code reliability and development efficiency. Additionally, TailwindCSS is employed for styling purposes, allowing for rapid and customizable UI development through utility classes.

The combination of ReactJS and TypeScript ensures a structured and maintainable codebase, while TailwindCSS streamlines styling by leveraging utility-first classes. Overall, this tech stack enables a scalable, responsive, and intuitive dashboard experience for users interacting with uploaded CSV data presented through Chart.js visualizations.
